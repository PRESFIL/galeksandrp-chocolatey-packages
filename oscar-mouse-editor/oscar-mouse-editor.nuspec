It breaks through this barrier, users are able to establish homemade programs by using simple logic commands (such as “Loop”, “If”, “Equal to”, “Interval Repeat”, “Jump”…etc.) or by using command combinations (like “Change the Time Delay between commands”, “Control cursor absolute/relative displacements”, “Mouse simulation”, “Keyboard simulation”, “Record the keyboard &amp; mouse continuous actions”…etc.). Simplicity, high effectiveness, and the overwhelming power of Oscar will bring you the unprecedented experience and dominate the play!
